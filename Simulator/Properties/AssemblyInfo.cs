 * PROJECT: SmartBuoy Simulator
 * DESCRIPTION: This project was meant to be a user interface for viewing data from
 * a device created to measure the quality of water. However, because this is an
 * online course their is no access to the physical device. This application takes 
 * the place of the device by producing random numbers, within a set range, for
 * each of the measurements. Then, just as the actual device would, the application
 * broadcasts the data both as a continuous stream and periodically to a database.
