# SmartBuoy
Remote water quality testing probe

SmartBuoy is designed to be a fully self-contained water quality probe, able to be
deployed into a body of water and monitored remotely via a GSM cellular network.
SmartBuoy is an economical solution to water monitoring, meant for both amateur 
and professional researchers. 

The device is powered by 5-volt lithium ion battery, recharged by an onboard solar
panel and includes sensors to measure electrical conductivity, pH, temperature,
turbidity, and total dissolved solids. Location data is provided by an Adafruit GPS
module. A data reading is taken every 30 seconds and streamed live. Every hour a
reading is sent to a database for storage.

Both live and historic readings are viewed using the SmartBuoy GUI.
